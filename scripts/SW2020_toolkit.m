%%% Master MATLAB programme file for the SW2020 tolkit by               %%%
%%% Gabriel Ahlfeldt M. Ahlfeldt and Tobias Seidel                      %%%
%%% The toolkit covers a class of quantitative spatial models           %%%
%%% introduced in Monte, Redding, Rossi-Hansberg (2018): Commuting,     %%%
%%% Migration, and Local Employment Elasticities.                       %%%
%%% The toolkit uses data and code compiled for                         %%%
%%% Seidel and Wckerath (2020): Rush hours and urbanization             %%%
%%% Codes and data have been re-organized to make the toolkit more      %%%
%%% accessible. Seval programmes have been added to allow for more      %%%
%%% general applications. Discriptive analyses and counterfactuals      %%%
%%% serve didactic purposes and are unrelated to both research papers   %%%

% Executes script that reads in baseline data from SW2020. This data set
% contains bilateral commuting flows similar to the data used by MMRH2017.
% Routes with zero commutes have commuting costs set to infinity.
% Therefore, this data set is inconsistent with standard travel time
% matrices. If you wish to work with your own travel time matrices and run
% counterfactuals it will be more convenient to use OwnData.m to compile
% your own data set
% This script also inverts productivities and computes trade shares and the
% tradable price index

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Descriptives
% Executres script that generates several maps and scatter plots that
% illustrate the data and some variables solved within the model

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
OwnData
% Adjusts the data set to standard travel time matrices that may form the
% basis of counterfactuals. To this end, it generates artificial commuting
% flows that are consistent with observed workplace and residence
% employment. Use this data generation script when working with your own
% commuting time matrices. This script is also the natural starting point
% when transferring the model to other contexts where you do not observe
% commuting flows.
% This script also inverts productivities and computes trade shares and the
% tradable price index

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
BorderData
% Generates border variabels that identify in which part of Germany 
% and how far from the former inner-German border it is located. It uses 
% these variables to generte a distance running variable that takes
% negative values in West Germany and positive values in East Germany

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Counterfactuals
% Exectues diactic counterfactuals in which large costs are assigned to i)
% trade routes that cross the inner-German border, ii) commuting routes
% that corss the border, iii) communting and trade routes that cross the
% border. It illustrates the outcomes on maps and border discontinuity
% scatter plots
