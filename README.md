# Toolkit for Quantitative Spatial Models

**Â© Gabriel M. Ahlfeldt, Tobias Seidel**

Version 0.9, 2024

## General Instructions

This toolkit covers a class of quantitative spatial models established by Monte, Redding, Rossi-Hansberg (2018). We aim to provide an accessible and easy-to-use simulation framework within `MATLAB` (Monte, Reeding, Rossi-Hansberg use `Mathematica`) that helps developing the intuition for the key mechanisms in the model as well as the programming implementation of the model. To this end, this toolkit contains a codebook which summarizes the various exogenous and endogenous objects of the model, its equilibrium conditions, and various solvers used to take the model to the data. We build on Seidel and Wieckerth (2020) who apply a variant of the Monte, Redding, Rossi-Hansberg (2018) model to Germany. The toolkit introduces a subset of codes that are crucial for the quantification and simulation of the model, with applications that serve didactic purposes and are unrelated to the substantive analyses in both papers. For more general applicability, the toolkit is designed to also work in instances where the researcher does not observe bilateral commuting flows (and possibly not even wages). 

This toolkit has been designed to be used in the course Quantitative Spatial Economics taught by Gabriel Ahlfeldt to Berlin School of Economics and Humboldt University students.
